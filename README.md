# Coursera Developing Data Products Week 3 Peer-graded Assignment: Plotly

In this project, we created a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly, representing the number of road accidents in Great Britain from 2016 to 2017, grouped by severity (slight, serious, or fatal).

The presentation is [published online on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/alokTripathi/433395).

The source data sets are not included in this repository. To reproduce this presentation, you will need to download the zipped [Road safety data (accident, casualties and vehicle tables) for 2016 to 2017](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data).
